# CodinGame_Solutions
Solutions I've come up with while playing on CodinGame

First off, this isn't my best code. All I did was write up code that was just good enough to do 
what was needed to pass the code testing. Once the code for an exercise was good enough to pass,
I stopped working on it and moved on to the next exercise. 

I should also warn you that I didn't include the code for the "Teads Sponsored Challenge". This
specific problem is being used to find candidates for programing posistions, so I decided not
to include my code in the repository.
